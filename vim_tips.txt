:e!                   - Reopen the current file, getting rid of any unsaved changes. Great for when a global search and replace goes awry.
*, #		      - Search for all occurrences of word under the cursor.
:%s/search/replace/g  - Global Search and replace
:%s/search/replace/gc - The 'c' makes it prompt you at each replace instance
:%s//replace/g        - will replace the last term that was searched for, instead of you having to type it again. This works well with using * to search for the word under the cursor.

gg=G     - авто отступы во всем файле
=%       - Indents the block between two braces/#ifdefs 
%        - Brace/parentheses match. If you have the cursor on a parenthesis/brace/etc ((){}[]), and hit % it will jump to the corresponding one.

CTRL-v jjjjj[...] I	 If you select a rectangular block and then type I, you can then insert text in front of the block on each line.
CTRL-v jjjjj[....] A	 If you select a rectangular block and then type A, you can then append text at the end of the block on each line.
